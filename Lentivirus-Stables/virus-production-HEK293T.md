Lentivirus production in HEK293T cells
================================================================================
**Description:** Transfecting viral components and carrier DNA to create competent virus.<br/>
Generated virus allows for insertion of genes into "stable" cell lines by infection.

[Go To Protocol](#protocol)

Materials:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Day 1-2

  * Antibiotic-Free Culture Media (DMEM + 10% FBS)
  * **2X HEPES buffered saline (HBS) pH 7.1** - _pH with NaOH and filter with 0.22 µm_  
    ◦ 280 mM NaCl    
    ◦ 50 mM HEPES pH 7.0  
    ◦ 1.5 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>( • 2H<sub>2</sub>O)
  * 2.5 M CaCl<sub>2</sub>  
  * Carrier plasmid containing insert (400 ng/µl) _(helpful to also include GFP carrier control)_
  * psPAX2 packaging plasmid (300 ng/µl)
  * pMD2.G envelope plasmid (100 ng/µl)

### Day 5
  * 10/20 mL syringes
  * 0.45 µm syringe filter
  * [concentrator columns 100 KDa NMWL](https://www.emdmillipore.com/US/en/product/Amicon-Ultra-15-Centrifugal-Filter-Unit,MM_NF-UFC910024)

Equipment Required:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Day 1-4

  * Cell culture incubator (37 °C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>)
  * Tissue culture hood equipped with germicidal UV lamp.

### Day 5

  * Swinging bucket centrifuge (3-4K xg) for 50 mL conicals 

Protocol:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
_Note: The separate plasmid components of lentivirus are not harmful or dangerous by themselves._<br/>
_When expressed together in a cell line, they will create live virus that should be handled appropriately._<br/>
_The virus created is not replicative, but does have limited potential to integrate DNA into a person's cells._<br/>
_This can be hazardous, especially if incorporating known oncogenes._<br/>
_Danger is limited, but take care not to ingest or inject live lentiviral preparations. Dispose of virus properly._

### Day 1

**1.** Split HEK293T cells into 10 cm dishes, 5M cells per plate/transfection. Incubate at 37 °C for 24 hours.

### Day 2

**2.** Change media on each plate (10 mL DMEM + 10% FBS, **no antibiotics**).

**3.** Assemble DNA transfection mixtures as follows:

  | Component | Concentration | Quantity | 
  | ---------: | ---------: | :---------- |
  | Carrier plasmid (insert) | 400 ng/µl | **20**  µL | 
  | Packaging plasmid | 300 ng/µl | **20**  µL |
  | Envelope plasmid | 100 ng/µl | **20**  µL |  
  | ddH<sub>2</sub>O |  | **390**  µL | 
  || **Total** | **450** µL |
  
  _Note: It is extremely helpful to include a GFP (or other fluorescent reporter) control plate.<br/>
   This will allow you to check success of the transfection, as GFP will be expressed transiently from the carrier plasmid._
  
**4.** Perform each transfection 1 at a time, for each DNA mixture:
  *  Add 50 µL of 2.5 M CaCl<sub>2</sub>. Vortex for 5 seconds.
  *  Dropwise, add 500 µL of 2X HBS to the mixture. Bubble from bottom up 5-8x to mix.
  *  Add entire mixture dropwise to a 10 cm dish containing cells.
  *  Incubate cells at 37 °C for 24 hours.

<br/><br/><br/>
### Day 3

**5.** Change media on each plate (10 mL DMEM + 10% FBS, no antibiotics).<br/>
Incubate plates at 37 °C for 2 more days.<br/>
  _Note: This media has some amount of virus, use a 10 mL pipette to aspirate._<br/>
  _Bleach and UV treat pipettes and aspirated media before disposal._

### Day 5
_Note: Treat everything on this day as material contaminated with live virus._<br/>
_All waste media and materials should be bleached and exposed to UV before disposal._

**6.** Aspirate culture media with a 10/20 mL syringe.<br/>
Pass media through a 0.45 µm filter into a concentrator column.

**7.** Concentrate the virus (spin in concentrator column at 3,000 xg for 9 minutes).<br/>
Move resulting (upper) volume to cryotubes.
  * _Note: Time spent concentrating can be varied to yield different volumes:_<br/>
  _1 mL of concentrated virus (20X), or_<br/>
  _200 µL of hyper-concentrated virus (100X)_

**8.** Store the virus at -80 °C for long-term storage or 4 °C for immediate infections.
