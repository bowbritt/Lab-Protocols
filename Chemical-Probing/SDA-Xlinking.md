In-cell crosslinking with NHS-Diazirine (SDA)
================================================================================
Description: SDA and long wavelength UV crosslinks free primary amines to proximal molecules (like RNA).

Materials:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * Mostly confluent cells (for HEK293T cells, plate 750K cells in a 6cm dish and grow up 2 days) 
  * 1X Phosphate-buffered saline pH 7.4
  * 200 mM stock of [NHS-Diazirine (SDA)](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/26167#/26167) in DMSO<br/>_Note: SDA is best diluted day of, but can be stored in DMSO at -20 °C for at least 1 month._
  * Lysis reagent
     
Equipment Required:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * Cell culture incubator and hood
  * [UV365 Crosslinker](https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/fisher-scientific-uv-crosslinker-ah-4/13245221) (other models need optimization)<br/>_Note: Instrument comes with UV254 nm bulbs, SDA crosslinking requires [UV365 nm bulbs](https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/fisher-scientific-uv-crosslinker-ah-4/13245225)._

Protocol:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**1.** Wash cells twice in 0.5 growth volumes of 1XPBS.<br/>_Note: Suspension cells will have to be pelleted. SDA reacts with amine-containing growth buffers._

**2.** Add/resuspend in 0.475 growth volumes of 1XPBS. Add SDA to a final concentration of 10 mM.
  * _For example: Cover HEK293T cells in a 6 cm dish with 1.9 mL of PBS and add 100 µl of 200 mM SDA._
  * _Note: Add SDA slowly and swirl mix as you add to avoid blasting cells with too much DMSO._ 
    
**3.** Incubate cells under at normal growth temperature for 10 minutes. Shield SDA-treated cells from outside light as much as possible.
  
**4.** Aspirate all media and crosslink cells (mostly dry) on ice with 2J/cm<sup>2</sup> of 365 nm UV light.<br/>_Note: For suspension cells, pellet and resuspend in a thin layer of PBS for crosslinking._

**5.** Lyse cells with desired lysis reagent (will vary depending on followup).
